Auto-Grading Paper TODO List

Make tables higher-res

Table 1 add #submits, #students columns

BIG QUESTION: description of system: should be present-tense? makes sense. All data/study remains past-tense.
>> YES -mulhern

Figure 1 :
	Instead of histogram, show a distro curve for each section
		collapse each student= subs/assignments (decimal number)
	perhaps collapse M's and A's into single thing

Mulhern 1		
		Maybe a better sell is:
		1) There are a lot of great tools for analyzing and verifying C out there.
		2) We'ld like introductory programming students to get the benefit of these tools.
		3) But they have so much to learn already --- they can't possibly be taught how to use all these tools as well and the principles behind them.
		4) Enter an intermediary, i.e., Bottlenose which automatically runs these tools, post processes the output making use of the instructor's greater knowledge and renders them back to the students in a form that they can understand.
	
CONCLUSIONS
	add a little bit about individuals who react well (case study stories)

Mulhern 1 - don't know how to deal with:
	In response to the comparison of the results at the end I think a cynical person would say that you are unfairly comparing two different forms of submission. You can not tell whether or not the students are revising multiple times before they hand in with submit, it may be that the quality of their revisions is actually much lower with Bottlenose than with submit.
